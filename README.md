## Future of the Project

My goal of this project was to get a basic understanding of making a first person shooter since that is a very
popular genre in modern gaming and I'm hoping to turn these skills into a permanent job. As for what I wish to add once the
project is complete I have a few ideas curently.


1. Multiplayer

1. Different characters to plays as with distinct weapons

1. A character select screen.



If there is anyone who would want to collaborate on a project I'd be more than happy to help.

The more experience the better.

I am not new to programming in C++ though I am new to Unreal and I'm an independent learner,

ie I'm not college trained but I am still being taught via online resources, so please keep that in mind.

On a side note if you notice that I have two repositories of the same name that is because I had to retart the program entirely
due to setup error and because Unreal updated. In short this will be the project version I will be moving forward with.
